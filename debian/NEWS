uronode (2.13-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From this version on, upstream have changed running files from /var/ax25/ to
  /var/lib/ax25. It is recommended by upstream to migrate your current
  /var/ax25/node/* files to /var/lib/ax25/node/* after upgrade. 
  If you do not do this, your help files, ROSE directory and user logs shall
  be considered fresh and reset, with all users being treated as if they are
  new and connecting for the first time.
