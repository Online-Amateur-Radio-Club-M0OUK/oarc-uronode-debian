Description: Node front end for AX.25, NET/ROM, Rose and TCP
 URONode is a packet radio node front end for amateur radio operators.
 It provides a shell modelled after those of LinuxNode, AWZNode and
 Flexnode.  It is capable of initiating connections to remote stations
 and exposing services installed on them to users.
